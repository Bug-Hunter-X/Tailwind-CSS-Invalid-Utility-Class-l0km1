# Tailwind CSS Invalid Utility Class Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tailwind CSS: using an invalid or out-of-range utility class.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the correct approach.

## Problem

Attempting to use Tailwind CSS classes that are not defined in your configuration, or are outside the standard size range (e.g., extremely large font sizes), will result in no styling being applied. This can be difficult to debug as there may be no error messages.

## Solution

Ensure that all utility classes used are defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file and fall within the valid range. Refer to the official Tailwind CSS documentation for valid classes and their ranges.

Consider using more reasonable font sizes and classes to avoid unexpected behavior and improve code maintainability.
